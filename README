Requirement: python3 for 2.0+. However, it should not be hard to make it work under Python 2 if you are familiar with Python (you can try the `2to3` command).

Usage:
invoke it like this in commandline:
  ./gui2term.py sourcefile newfile
or
  python3 gui2term.py sourcefile newfile

Note:
* It searches and processes lines in a vim colorscheme that seems like a normal highlight command, so it does not work with all the colorscheme.
* Some GUI only colorschemes may use the default scheme if it found itself under a terminal. You need to manually remove these lines.
* For some colors, the output is rather bad.
