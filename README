This is a python2 script that converts GUI only colorschemes to support 256-color terminal.

Requirement: python2.6 (other python2.x may also work)

Usage:
invoke it like this in commandline.
./gui2term.py sourcefile newfile
or
python gui2term.py sourcefile newfile

Note:
It searches and processes lines in a vim colorscheme that matches the regular expression '^\s*hi\w*\s+[A-Z]\w+' (in Python or Perl, not Vim regex), so it does not work with all the colorscheme.
Apply it to *GUI only* colorscheme only.
Some GUI only colorschemes may use the default scheme if it found itself under a terminal. You need to manually remove these lines.
